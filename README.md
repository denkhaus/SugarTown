# SugarTown 
## Introduction

**Welcome to SugarTown!**

This is a blog engine written in [NancyFX][1] that allows you to write blog posts and then exposes the contents via an API to allow you to incorporate a blog into an existing website. 

**Why SugarTown?**

SugarTown was one of Nancy Sinatra's best known recordings. NancyFX gets its name from [Sinatra][2] so I thought I'd use this format to select a name for this project plus SugarTown sounds good for a piece of software!
